## Project 2 ##

### Overview ###
* The project aim was to develop an application that used machine learning.
* My idea was to develop a clone of the game _Pong_, one of the very first video games to appear. One of the main reasons for this choice was that _Pong_ is an easy game to develop and it's controls are also very simple. A player can only move their paddle up or down, which limits the amount of choices a deep learning algorithm must make.
* I chose to use the _Tensforflow_ API for the machine learning part of the project.
